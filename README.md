# type_of_leaf_veins_classification
This is model to classified type of leaf veins. This model has 4 class, there are : 
    1. Melengkung: pepper leaves, betel leaves, hibiscus leaves
    2. Menjari: sun leaves, papaya leaves, cassava leaves
    3. Menyirip: mango leaves, guava leaves, orange leaves
    4. Sejajar: corn leaves, sugar cane leaves, rice leaves

This model has 2000 dataset which is split into train and test set. Training set has 1440 and 360 for test set.

And i use InceptionResnetV2 as a base model because InceptionResNetV2 was trained on a large-scale image classification task, ImageNet, and achieved state-of-the-art performance. This pre-training on a diverse dataset helps the model to learn rich hierarchical features, which can be beneficial when fine-tuning for a specific classification task.

The model has good accuracy and is stable at 99% with 10 epochs.
